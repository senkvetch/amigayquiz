                <h2> Results: You might be gay! </h2>
                <p> The way you answered these questions points to you being gay! However, this test is not a perfect indicator of your sexuality. And you’re going to hold onto that idea because you’re scared to really know the answer. I mean, you know the answer, but no one around you is queer. Frankly, you didn’t even know that was an option until quite recently! It's something new, and you have no one in real life to look to. It’s okay though. You’ll come into your own in your own time. </p>
